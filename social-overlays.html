    <p>
    	Building usable systems is challenging. In this time when websites are the face of virtually every organization,
    	there are many cases where usability cannot be addressed as effectively as one might like, especially in nonprofit
    	organizations. In the Social Overlays, we investigate a novel approach to creating usable websites, that is to enable
    	users themselves to collectively improve the site.</p> <br>

    	<p>We developed Social Overlays, a Chrome extension, to enable end–users to identify and repair common user interface
    	problems through creating “overlays” on web pages as part of their regular use, thereby improving usability while
    	reducing the need for professional services. In short, Social Overlays harnesses the diversity of experience and
    ideas within a community to “crowd source” usability. </p>
