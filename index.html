    <h1>Interaction Ecologies Group</h1>
    <p>A radical change is underway in the ways that people interact with computers. Computing envelopes us and mediates an increasingly large portion of our everyday experience, necessitating that research in Human-Computer Interaction attend to the relationship between people and the ever-more complex technological environments in which they live, work, and play. The Interaction Ecologies Group at the University of Michigan seeks to understand the embedded, interconnected nature of these emerging forms of interaction and to build tools that help people understand, manage, and make use of the rich and dynamic resources available to them. Current research in this area is focused on support for end-user configuration of complex environments and tools to allow designers to rapidly prototype and test ubiquitous computing applications. Relevant publications and information about current projects can be found on the project members’ websites.</p>
    <p>We are affiliated with Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC), and collaborate extensively with the Social Worlds Group.</p>
